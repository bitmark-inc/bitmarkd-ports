* Please keep all configuration and wallet data files files under the
  configuration directory secure.  By default this directory is:

  ${XDG_CONFIG_HOME}/bitmark-wallet/

* Note that bitmark-wallet requires bitcoind and litecoind daemons to
  be setup for localhost RPC access.  It is recommended that both the
  net-p2p/bitcoin-daemon and the net-p2p/litecoin-daemon be installed
  for a minimum configuration.

* It is possible to use both main and test networks on both
  cryptocurrency blockchains if all four configuration files are
  create and each combination has its own working directory.
